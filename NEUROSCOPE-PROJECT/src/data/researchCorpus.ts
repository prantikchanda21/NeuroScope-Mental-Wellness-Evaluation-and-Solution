/**
 * Expanded research corpus — the retrieved-evidence layer behind every
 * personalized solution.
 *
 * Four peer-reviewed papers (the project's original source library) plus
 * eleven clinical/neuroscience books, distilled into short, retrievable
 * passages. Each passage is a PARAPHRASED distillation of the source's
 * finding (never a verbatim quote) written so it can be:
 *   - fused into an LLM prompt as grounding evidence (`text`), and
 *   - shown directly to a user as a plain-language line (`plain`).
 *
 * Passages are retrieved semantically at request time (see
 * `src/utils/researchRetrieval.ts`): the user's own answer is embedded with
 * all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and matched against each passage's `keywords`+`text`
 * vector, with a keyword-overlap fallback when the transformer runtime is
 * unavailable. Retrieval keeps solutions grounded in the literature the user
 * asked for instead of relying on the model's memory of it.
