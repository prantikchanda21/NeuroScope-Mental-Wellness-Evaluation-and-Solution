- PROMIS emotional-distress item banks (Pilkonis et al., 2011, Assessment): depression's most discriminating indicators are hopelessness, worthlessness, helplessness felt as different from one's usual self; anxiety's are sudden panic, pounding/racing heart, dread that something bad will happen; anger's are persistent, explosive temper; distress sits on a measurable continuum, not a switch.
- CAT-DI / bifactor measurement (Gibbons et al., 2012, Arch Gen Psychiatry): distress expresses across subdomains — mood, cognition, behavior, somatic — severity is dimensional, and the patient's own report is the primary valid evidence.
- SAMHSA TIP 57 (2014), Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services: symptoms are creative adaptations and survival strategies, not defects; physical, emotional and psychological safety come first; hypervigilance, avoidance and self-medication are coping logic that made sense in context; care must be strengths-based and recovery-oriented.`;

High detail, zero filler, no bullet points, no line breaks.
- 'detailedAnalysis' (What Is Happening In Your Nervous System): exactly ONE cohesive paragraph of 100-145 words.

A transformative reframe that dissolves guilt/shame/self-judgment, backed by the research lens (adaptation not defect; state not trait; continuum not switch), ending with one concrete forward-looking sentence. No bullet points, no line breaks.
- All three MUST be freshly composed from THIS user's THIS answer and THIS question: reference their actual words or the question's topic, and never reuse a canned paragraph. Two different answers must produce visibly different paragraphs in all three sections.
- In 'detailedAnalysis', ground the mechanism in ONE finding from the ANSWER-SPECIFIC EVIDENCE block when it is present, attributed briefly and in plain language (e.g. "research on response styles shows...", "sleep research finds..."). Never list sources as a bibliography, never stack more than one citation in a paragraph, and never invent a study that is not in the evidence block.`;
