/**
 * Dynamic local follow-up chat response engine.
 *
 * This is the layer that answers "Chat with AI About This Feeling" whenever the
 * remote Gemini/Groq call is unavailable (no API key configured, network error,
 * or timeout). Previously this path always returned one single hard-coded
 * sentence, so the "AI Mental Health Partner" looked broken/scripted no matter
 * what the person typed.
 *
 * Instead, this engine reads the user's actual follow-up text (and the solution
 * context it was asked from) and picks from a bank of specific, topic-matched,
 * multi-variant responses — so two different questions get two different,
 * relevant answers, and even the *same* question asked twice gets a
 * different phrasing/variant.
